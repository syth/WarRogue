# WarRogue

WarRogue is a roguelike variant of the card game War. Inspired by game such as [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/), [Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/), and [Bingle Bingle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789810/Bingle_Bingle/)

WarRogue is my take on the roguelike card games that the internet and I are currently addicted to.

## Known Bugs and Disclaimers

**Disclaimers**

This program is currently very early in development. There are bound to be a large number of problems.
As of right now, there is nothing that is roguelike and is planned to be added in the future. WarRogue right now is **strictly** just a game of War.

Known Bugs


## Plans for the Future

- [ ] Add Roguelike feature
      - Shop
      - Cards that affect the way the game is played

More plans are bound to come later, but this is it for now
